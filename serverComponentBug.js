In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  If a server component fetches data that subsequently triggers another data fetch within a deeply nested component structure, the initial server component might not receive the final, updated data. This could lead to inconsistencies in the UI or unexpected behavior. This happens when the data fetching operations are asynchronous, and the server component returns before the nested fetches complete, resulting in stale data being used in rendering.
